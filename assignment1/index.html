                As I explored various websites, this one stood out among the few that truly caught my attention. After spending a few more minutes comparing different sites, I decided to go with this one. Why? What made it stand out? Upon opening the website, the animated loading screen immediately made a strong impression on me. When I saw the landing page with its striking colors, I knew I wanted to review this site. The website features three dominant colors, two of which—Soft Lime Green and Cornflower Blue—are particularly bright and eye-catching, perfectly fitting the website's theme. I really appreciate how the designer used color here. As I continued scrolling, I was impressed by the movement of each element, especially the cardboard-like images. The dynamic nature of these elements made the scrolling experience more engaging and enjoyable. Overall, the website effectively tells an interesting story, and its design makes the experience interesting rather than dull.

                ​​I spent the most time scrolling back and forth between different sections. I loved how the parallax effect made things move at different speeds—it really added a cool sense of depth. Instead of just a plain, static page, the way elements like images and text shifted made the experience way more interesting. I kept going back to see how different parts responded to my scrolling. The moving silhouettes and floating trash elements were especially fun to watch. The smooth transitions and animations made the whole thing more engaging and kept me hooked. Overall, the parallax scrolling made the website feel lively and interactive, which made it a lot more enjoyable to navigate.

I spent a lot of time observing how the parallax effects and animations played out as I scrolled.

                I also frequently hovered my mouse over various parts of the page to check for interactive elements. I wanted to see if anything would change or if there were any clickable areas I might have missed. Exploring these interactions helped me uncover all the possibilities and features the website had to offer.

                I believe the primary goal of the website, as stated on the site itself, is to raise awareness about the importance and value of various professions. It aims to ensure that workers are not treated with prejudice but are instead appreciated for their labor. The website designer achieves this through effective storytelling, using different sections to build upon the message gradually. The site provides both verbal and visual information, explaining why we should respect and appreciate workers and highlighting their contributions to the world. At the end of the webpage, the designer includes a small interactive feature where users can click a heart button to make a cascade of hearts appear. This feature serves as an invitation to increase awareness and encourages users to show their appreciation for workers.

                I feel that each section of the website builds upon the previous one, expanding on related arguments in a cohesive manner. By combining text and imagery, the author has made the website more engaging, encouraging users to thoroughly read and consider the content. The text is neither too long nor too short but is presented concisely, making it easier to digest. The use of animation and motion adds to the experience, making the content more dynamic and less likely to be ignored. Finally, the “click to send rays of kindness” button, which generates hearts when clicked at the end, invites users to implement the website's message in their daily lives.

                I feel that the design of this website is not intended for long-term use by most users, as it primarily serves as an informative page. Users might visit it only once, return occasionally, or share it with others to support its goal of raising awareness. The design is focused on capturing attention in the moment and hopes that users will remember the content they read. While the website designer aims for the message to have a lasting impact, the site lacks interactive features and personalization that might encourage users to return frequently. Instead, the design prioritizes making a strong initial impression and engaging users right away.

                In my opinion, the website lacks interactive experiences that would encourage users to return regularly. It does not include personalized elements or interactive activities. The main aspects that might draw users back are (1) the website’s appealing design and numerous animations, and (2) the engaging content. Although the website excels in storytelling and content, it could be made more memorable and interactive if the designer incorporated features like quizzes, personalized activities, newsletters, or surveys. These additions could enhance user engagement and provide ongoing reasons for users to revisit the site.

                After checking out the website, it’s clear that the designer has put a lot of thought into using different media to get their message across. They’ve used photos and silhouettes of janitors, along with trash-related images like trash bins and sweeping tools. These elements really help highlight the importance of the work being showcased.
                <br><br>

                The site also features realistic elements like trees, buildings, and benches, and even includes a landmark like the Taj Mahal. This mix of real-world imagery helps emphasize the value of all kinds of work.
                <br><br>

                To keep things feeling fresh and down-to-earth, the designer has added some cool styling touches. Scribbles, paper textures, and ripped paper effects give it a less corporate vibe. Plus, the use of photographs and painting frames adds a personal touch. All these elements work together to make the website engaging and memorable.

                Christina’s website guides us on how to feel through its design and references. By using real-life structures like buildings, trees, and even the Taj Mahal, she shows that the issue is something big and important, not just a small, isolated problem. She wants us to respect and appreciate the workers who often go unnoticed but are crucial to our daily lives.
                <br><br>

                The site features photos and silhouettes of janitors, along with items like trash bins and brooms, to make us recognize the value of these everyday jobs. The design has a down-to-earth vibe, avoiding a corporate or overly polished look. This helps the website feel relatable and focused on real people.
                <br><br>

                In summary, Christina’s design choices and references suggest that the website should make us feel connected to and appreciative of the essential, yet often undervalued, roles that workers play in our lives.

                I don’t find much to be really frustrating about the website, but one thing that can be a bit annoying is the speed and suddenness of some animations and transitions. Sometimes they’re too fast or abrupt, which can throw off the flow and make things feel a bit jarring. I guess it would be better if the animations were a bit smoother and more controlled.

                The most satisfying part of the interaction for me was scrolling from top to bottom. I really enjoyed following the narrative and noticing how the animations and transitions responded to my scrolling speed. The parallax effects used on the website were particularly impressive. For example, the silhouettes of workers, the floating trash elements, and the hands holding heart cards all moved in a way that perfectly matched my scrolling pace. This not only made the user experience smooth but also enhanced the storytelling, making it feel more immersive and engaging.

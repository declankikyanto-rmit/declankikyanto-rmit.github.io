            What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
            the experience?
          </h2>

            Upon opening the website itself, I saw that the loading screen was
            animated, that itself creates a good impression on my mind. Then as
            I first browsed through the different websites, this website is one
            of a few that really caught my eyes. But in the end I decided to
            choose this website for my website review. Why? What makes me choose
            this one? The first thing that stood out to me was the use of colour
            on the website. I can only identify 3 dominant colours, and 2 of
            them are really bright and eye-catching â€“ these are the neon green,
            and pastel purple. I really love the website designers' use of
            colour here. Then as I scrolled, the way each element (cardboard
            images) moves also is fascinating. It makes the scroll experience
            way more engaging and entertaining.
